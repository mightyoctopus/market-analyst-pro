## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+  
- **AI Agent Orchestration:** Autogen (OpenAI Agent SDK)  
- **Large Language Model API:** OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini via OpenAI API (you can pick any model you would like.) 
- **Web Application Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Dependencies & Packaging:** pip, virtual environments, `requirements.txt`

## Note
Unnecessarily, there are a lot of required modules listed inside the requirements.txt file. That's because this app shares 
the virtual environment with the LLM agents (the agents also generate required code for the delivery of stock analysis). 
If you don't want the overwhelming number of modules installed in your venv, it's recommended to separate your virtual environments
into 2 sections -- one for the core app, another for the LLM agents that install their own modules for code generation.
